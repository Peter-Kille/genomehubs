#Demo

If you already have a server running Docker, the quickest way to try out GenomeHubs is to run our demo import script in the [genomehubs/demo](https://github.com/genomehubs/demo) GitHub repository:

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/genomehubs/demo
demo/import.sh
```

This sets up a Genomehub with an Ensembl browser, SequenceServer BLAST server and h5ai downloads server hosting data from one species mirrored from EnsemblGenomes
