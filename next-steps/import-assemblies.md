# Import additional assemblies

The Quick Start guide shows an example set up with one species mirrored from an existing Ensembl database and a second species imported directly from FASTA and GFF files. Further assemblies (for the same or different species) can be added from either of these sources to provide a consistent interface to multiple assemblies and to support [comparative analyses](//next-steps/run-compara.md) across a suite of related taxa.
