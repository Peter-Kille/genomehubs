# Run comparative analyses

A powerful Ensembl feature supported by GenomeHubs is the ability to incorporate orthology information in the compara database schema, which can be displayed in gene trees on the web site. GenomeHubs does not use the Ensembl compara pipeline but provides a set of analysis containers and import scripts to populate a compara database with compatible information based on the orthology prediction and gene tree pipeline used at [lepbase.org](http://lepbase.org).
