# Run analyses

{% method %}
GenomeHubs supports importing the results of analyses such as InterProScan into Ensembl databases to add functional annotations to imported assemblies. Docker container images are provided to allow these analyses to be run with the correct settings, but the analyses can also be run in whichever way is best suited to your compute infrastructure, provided the output files have the required name and format.
